## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- One of the most fascinating concepts from James Clear's talk is the idea of getting better by just 1% each day. He explained how making small improvements, even just a little bit every day, can lead to big changes over time. It's like taking small steps regularly that add up to significant progress in the long run. This idea encourages people to focus on consistent and manageable improvements rather than trying to make huge changes all at once.

## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

- - B = MAP represents Behavior as a result of Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. It's a straightforward framework illustrating the essential components for behavior change.
  - **Motivation (M):** This embodies your drive or purpose behind an action. Identify motivations that resonate with you, such as personal satisfaction or achieving a goal.
  - **Ability (A):** This reflects the level of ease or difficulty associated with the habit. Simplify the habit to ensure it feels manageable and not overly challenging.
  - **Prompt (P):** This serves as a reminder or cue to initiate the habit. Establish prompts or triggers that prompt you to engage in the habit, such as setting alarms or associating it with existing daily routines.


## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

- Celebrating after accomplishing something you set out to do triggers feelings of happiness and pride in your brain. It's akin to giving yourself a high-five! When you experience positive emotions associated with a habit, your brain forms a connection and seeks to replicate that feeling. Therefore, celebrating your victories enhances the likelihood of maintaining the habit, acting as self-encouragement to persevere!

## What is the book's perspective about Identity?
 
- In "Atomic Habits," James Clear discusses the relationship between our habits and our self-perception. He suggests prioritizing habits that align with our desired identity rather than solely pursuing specific outcomes. By engaging in habits that resonate with the person we aspire to be—such as envisioning ourselves as healthy—we're more inclined to maintain these behaviors over time. Essentially, the book advocates that shaping our identity around positive behaviors facilitates lasting changes in our habits.
