## What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

- The Feynman Technique involves enhancing your understanding of a subject by breaking it down and explaining it in simple terms. This process not only facilitates better comprehension but also highlights areas where further learning may be necessary.


## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- In her TED talk titled "Learning How to Learn," Barbara Oakley explores intriguing cognitive strategies that can enhance the learning process. Oakley delves into the intricacies of how our brains function during learning and shares insightful techniques for studying more efficiently, such as employing diverse thinking modes and addressing procrastination. By unraveling the mysteries of our brain's workings, Oakley demonstrates how this knowledge can significantly improve the ease and effectiveness of the learning experience.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

- **Active Mode:**
When intensely focused on a specific task, such as studying for a test or solving a math problem, you're in the active mode. This state is akin to a bright spotlight, enabling deep concentration on one thing at a time.

- **Diffuse Mode:**
When your mind is more relaxed, not fixated on any specific task, and freely wandering or daydreaming, you're in the diffuse mode. This mode resembles a background process where your brain can make connections more fluidly and perceive the bigger picture.

> To enhance learning, it's beneficial to switch between these modes. Concentrate intensely when actively learning something (active mode), but take breaks or engage in different activities to allow your mind to form connections independently (diffuse mode). This alternating approach contributes to better understanding and promotes creativity.
